<span class="title">1. Soul and Body</span>

What are you living for? And what are you pursuing and running for? Money? Honor? Power? But none of this is forever. People have a body, which goes back to the soil when it dies, but a soul that exists forever. Are you not neglecting or ignoring your soul too much? You will be resurrected even if you die.

"Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth—those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation" - (John 5:28)

- You may have had the experience of waking up from joy or fear in a dream. What if those joys and fears continue endlessly?


<span class="title">2. Heaven and Hell</span>

‘And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment, ...’ - (Hebrews 9:27)

When a person dies, everything does not end, but everyone must stand before God and be judged. And there's a place to go, heaven or hell! You may accept this statement or feel repulsed. But no one can escape heaven and hell, no matter how much they want to deny it.


<span class="title">3. All human beings are sinners.</span>

'As it is written: “There is none righteous, no, not one; - (Romans 3:10)

'for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, - (Romans 3:23)

When Adam, the ancestor of humanity, who was created in the image of God, transgressed the law of life, all people in the world, who are Adam's descendants, inherited a sinful nature and inevitably fell under sin, becoming sinners with no choice but to die.

'For the wages of sin <i> is </i> death, but the gift of God <i> is </i> eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord' - (Romans 6:23)

'being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them' - (Romans 1:29-32)

Sin cannot be solved by good deeds, penance, or any of our efforts or merits. There is only one path God permitted. Only by turning back to God, repenting, and believing in Jesus Christ can we obtain forgiveness of sins and salvation (eternal life).

"Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” - (Acts 4:12)

Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me" - (John 14:6)


<span class="title">4. You can avoid the judgment of God only by coming to God, confessing that you are a sinner, repenting, and receiving forgiveness for your sins.</span>

'And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment,' - (Hebrews 9:27)

"But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death” - (Revelation 21:8)

'Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,' - (Acts 3:19)

<i>13 </i> “For My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and hewn themselves cisterns—broken cisterns that can hold no water. .... <i>19 </i> "Your own wickedness will correct you, and your backslidings will rebuke you. Know therefore and see that <i>it is</i> an evil and bitter <i>thing</i> that you have forsaken the Lord your God, and the fear of Me <i> is </i> not in you,” says the Lord God of hosts. - (Jeremiah 2:13, 19)

Jesus answered and said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.” - (Nuke 5:31-32).

"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me." - (Revelation 3:19-20)

“Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways,” says the Lord God. “Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity will not be your ruin. Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of one who dies,” says the Lord God. “Therefore turn and live!” - (Ezekiel 18:30-32)

God is a just judge, and God is angry with the wicked every day. If he does not turn back, He will sharpen His sword; He bends His bow and makes it ready. - (Psalms 7:11-12)

For all those things My hand has made, and all those things exist,” says the Lord. “But on this one will I look: On him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word. - (Isaiah 66:2)

“Now, therefore,” says the Lord, “Turn to Me with all your heart, With fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.” So rend your heart, and not your garments; Return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness; And He relents from doing harm. - (Joel 2:12)

And do you think this, O man, you who judge those practicing such things, and doing the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? But in accordance with your hardness and your impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, - (Romans 2:3-5)


<span class="title">5. Do you know Jesus Christ?</span>

And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent - (John 17:3)

Don't you want to know God? All the secrets of God are in Jesus.

Therein lies the secret of life. If you know Jesus, you know God.

Who do you know Jesus Christ is? Do you know Him as the Son of God and the Savior? Do you believe in His resurrection and second coming?

He is the God—the Word who created all and a man who was born to come to this earth in human flesh to free humans, who were slaves under the power of the devil and bound to sin, from the devil's power and the sin's bondage, and to restore the relationship between God and us humans that was damaged by sin. He is a person.

Although he is a sinless person, he came to this earth to take charge of the sins of mankind, which no human can take on or take upon himself the sins and curses of all mankind, and by shedding his blood and dying on the cross, he redeemed the sins of mankind.

By resurrecting three days after his death, he broke the power of Satan, proved himself to be the sinless Son of God, and gave us the hope of resurrection and eternal life.

Now you don't have to die because of sin, and there's no reason why you have to be oppressed by sin. Because Jesus died on the cross in place of you who deserved to die because of your sins.

All you have to do is believe in Him and be thankful for the love of the truth that all your sins have been paid for through His blood and death on the cross. <i> Because He, the Word, will keep you from sinning.</i>

"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." - (John 3:16)

When you believe in and rely on the name of Jesus Christ and the contribution of the precious blood He shed, you will be forgiven of all your sins, gain the authority to become a child of God, and possess the eternal life granted by God.

But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. - (John 1:12-13)

that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. - (Romans 10:9)

There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. - (Romans 8:1-2)

Salvation is not achieved through our actions or meritorious deeds, but we just have to believe that Jesus, the sinless Son of God, shed His blood on the cross for me, who is sinful, was resurrected after triumphing over the power of Satan, and that I who believe in Jesus will also be resurrected like Jesus through His triumphing.

This is the truth of the cross and the gospel.

God does not ask you to solve your sin with your own strength and effort. God knows our weakness, so He tells us to just believe with gratitude in the salvation that He has accomplished.

This is what makes it different from other religions.

Therefore, those who believe in Jesus have true freedom, joy, and peace that the world cannot give.

Before God looks at how conscientious you are, how few sins you have committed, or how well you have lived ethically and morally, He looks at whether or not you have the blood of Jesus shed, the life of Jesus, and the name of the Lord in your heart.

God does not send sinners to hell, but those who do not repent. Everyone, without exception, is full of sin whether they realize it or not.

It is very important whether we recognize sin as a sin, convert, and return to God.


<span class="title">6. God is waiting for you.</span>

God so loves you that He gave His only begotten Son in His arms to crucify and kill to pay for all your sins.

But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. - (Romans 5:8)

God did not levy your sins on you, but imposed all of your sins on Jesus, His only begotten Son, and made Him die on your behalf.

If you really knew that love, you couldn't help but be moved. God loved you and gave you the greatest sacrifice and love. Who in this world would die for you?

Because God loves you, today He is still waiting for you to return to Him with the heart of a father waiting for his son who ran away from home to come back.

You can either accept or turn a blind eye to the calling of God, however, do not turn away from God's calling. The result is tremendous misery. He is the Creator who created you, and the Host of life.

Scientific civilization is indeed developing tremendously, and human wisdom seems to be great.

However, even with the great development of advanced medical technology, there are so many diseases that medicine cannot cure, and no matter how state-of-the-art scientific technology is, sciences can only be helpless and be a sad bystander against any natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and droughts.

We must realize human limitations and be humble before the amazing providence and power of God, who created and governs all things in the universe.

As civilization develops, life becomes more convenient, but in proportion, humanity is lost, society becomes harsher, and the human mentally becomes more impoverished and exhausted.

God is calling you who are tired and exhausted physically and mentally from life.

"Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. - (Matthew 11:28)

The more worldly things you have, the more thirsty and unsatisfied you become, but with God, there is living water that will never make you thirsty. The true rest is only in God<i>(True rest comes only from God)</i>. He said that the peace that God gives cannot be compared to the peace that the world gives. Wouldn’t you like to enjoy the peace that God gives?

“I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; And I will not remember your sins. - (Isaiah 43:25)

There is no judgment for those who believe in Jesus. Because Jesus <i><b><u>who</b> did not sin or know sin was made sin and</u></i> was judged on the cross on our behalf


<span class="title">7. Jesus is coming again.</span>

After his resurrection, Jesus appeared and taught his disciples for 40 days, ascended to heaven in front of 500 people, and promised to come back.

Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen. - (Revelation 1:7)

He will come back to heaven just as he had gone up to heaven as he had promised and will take the souls who have lived for the blood he shed on the cross.

He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming quickly.” - (Revelation 22:20)

As he promised, he will come back in the same way he ascended to heaven and take the souls who were purchased with the blood He shed on the cross to heaven.

Jesus of the first coming to Bethlehem came in an extremely humble form to save sinful humans, but the Lord Jesus Christ, who will come again, will have the authority to judge all mankind, both living and dead, and will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And everyone in the world, both believers and non-believers, will see it.

Only those who believe in Jesus, the only begotten Son of God, are saved and have their names written in the Book of Life can endure the persecution of the antichrist and keep their faith.

That day will be a day of glory for the saints who believed in and waited for the Lord, but it will be a day of fear and regret for those who do not believe.

The prophecies in the Bible that will occur before the Lord's return are coming true one by one in an amazing way<i>(amazingly)</i>.

At some point, suddenly you should stand before Him. At that time, if not one who fears and trembles and regrets, there must be a joyful confession within you, “Jesus, I've been waiting for you, Jesus. Please come."


<span class="title">8. This is the last time.</span>

These are the end times. Look at the signs of the world

Earthquakes, floods, abnormal extreme weather, hunger, violence, and conflict continue to occur all over the world, the ozone layer that protects humans from the sun's ultraviolet rays is rapidly being destroyed, obscenity and decadence have reached their peak, the dignity of life has long been lost, and genetic engineering is directly challenging the power of God to create life by creating cloned humans.

Even if people commit sins, they do not feel remorse due to their dulled sense of guilt.

Isn't this similar to the destruction time of Noah's flood and the fiery judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah, which God destroyed because these were no longer bearable?

Even back then, people who ignored God's warning voice ended up being destroyed caused by being busy with their own work and enjoying pleasure.

The Bible says that the door to salvation will close.

The door suddenly closes at some point.

Are you inside the door now?

This is a very serious issue. Fortunately, however, the door is still open.

The signs of the world and the international situations show that the Second Coming of the Lord is imminent.

WEF(International organizations such as the World Economic Forum), WHO(the World Health Organization), and the UN(the United Nations) have shown their will to rule over humanity around the world, and the world is in a trend of being integrated globally with CBDC digital currency.

In closed days, when the antichrist-beast regime will appear and make all receive the mark of the beast into(on) the hand or forehead, only those who believe in Jesus and which are their names written in the Book of Life will be endured until the end and be given the eternal life.

saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water." <i><u> And another angel followed, saying, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.” Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. </u></i> And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.” - (Revelation 14:7-11)

On the cross, Jesus prepared the way of atonement and salvation for all mankind. However, this good path to salvation is only available to those who believe and accept it, so your decision is required.

Now is the time to make the most important decision of your life.

If you miss this opportunity, you may regret it forever.

Don't postpone; also, do not guarantee that there will be tomorrow; no one has any guarantee about tomorrow.

Decide to believe in Jesus right now. And then go to a church near you.

The purpose and direction of your life will be different.

You will no longer be a servant of the devil, who will be thrown into the lake of fire of hell, but a child of God who will enjoy heaven's eternal life with the Lord.


Hallelujah! <i><u>Come Lord Jesus (ἔρχου κύριε Ἰησοῦ)!</u></i>
