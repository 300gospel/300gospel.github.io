<span class="title">1. Soul and Body</span>

What are you living for and what are you pursuing and running for?

Money? Honor? Power? But none of this is forever.

People have a body that goes back to the soil when it dies, and a soul that exists forever.

Aren't you neglecting or ignoring your soul too much?

You will be resurrected even if you die.

"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. - (John 5:28-29)

You may have had the experience of waking up from joy or fear in a dream. What if those joys and fears continue endlessly?



<span class="title">2. Heaven and Hell</span>


‘Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, ...’ - (Hibrizer 9:27)


When a person dies, everything does not end, but everyone must stand before God and be judged.

And there's a place to go, heaven or hell!

You may accept this statement or feel repulsed.

But no one can escape heaven and hell, no matter how much they want to deny it.



<span class="title">3. All human beings are sinners.</span>

As it is written: "There is no one righteous, not even one; - (Romans 3:10)

for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, - (Romans 3:23)


When Adam, the ancestor of mankind who modeled after the image of God, committed a crime, everyone in the world who is Adam's descendant was forced to inherit the sin and be sinned, resulting in death.


For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. - (Romans 6:23) The sin must be judged and the subject of sin must die.

They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,
slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; - (Romans 1:29-32)


Sin cannot be solved by any effort or merit by good conduct or torture. There is only one path God has allowed. Returning to God, repenting and believing in Jesus Christ, we can gain sin and salvation (eternal life).


Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved." - (Acts 4:12)


Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. - (John 14:6)




<span class="title">4. You can escape God's judgment only when you come forward to God, confess to being a sinner, and repent and be guilty. </span>


Hebrews 9:27. Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,


Revelation 21:8. But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."


Acts 3:19. Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,


Jeremiah 2:13. "My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.

19. Your wickedness will punish you; your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the LORD your God and have no awe of me," declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.


Nuke 5:31. Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 32. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."


Revelation 3:19. Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest, and repent. 20. Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.


Ezekiel 18:30. "Therefore, O house of Israel, I will judge you, each one according to his ways, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall.

31. Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel?

32. For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live!


Psalms 7:11. God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day. 12. If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.


Isaiah 66:2. Has not my hand made all these things, and so they came into being?" declares the LORD. "This is the one I esteem: he who is humble and contrite in spirit, and trembles at my word.


Joel 2:12. "Even now," declares the LORD, "return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning." 13. Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity.


Romans 2:3. What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness? 4. Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written: "So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge."

5. But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)




<span class="title">5. Do you know Jesus Christ?</span>


‘ ’- (요한복음 17:3)


Don't you want to know God? There are all the secrets of God in Jesus.

There is a secret of life in it. If you know Jesus, you know God.

Who do you know Jesus Christ? Do you know him as the son of God and as the savior? Do you believe in his resurrection and his coming?

He is a God and a man who came to this land wearing his body to free the man who was under the devil's power and sin from the bondage of the devil's power and sin, and to restore the relationship between God and man damaged by sin.


He came to this earth to take charge of the sins of mankind that neither he nor man could be in charge of, and took on the sins and curses of mankind and sacrificed the sins of mankind by bleeding to death on the cross.

Because he was resurrected three days after his death, he broke the power of Satan, proved himself to be the son of God, who is innocent, and gave us the hope of resurrection and eternal life.


Now you have no reason to die because of sin, nor to be suppressed by sin. Because Jesus died on the cross on behalf of you, who deserved to die because of sin.

You can trust and appreciate the love of the truth that all your sins are blessed with atonement in exchange for your blood-shed death on the cross.


‘하나님이 세상을 이처럼 사랑하사 독생자를 주셨으니 이는 저를 믿는 자마다 멸망치 않고 영생을 얻게 하려 하심이니라’ (요한 3:16)


When you believe in and rely on Jesus' name and the contribution of the blood he shed, you are forgiven of all sins, given the power to be the child of God, and possess the eternal life that God has allowed.

‘영접하는 자 곧 그 이름을 믿는 자들에게는 하나님의 자녀가 되는 권세를 주셨으니’ (요한복음 1:12)

‘네가 만일 네 입으로 예수를 주로 시인하며 또 하나님께서 그를 죽은 자 가운데서 살리신 것을 네 마음에 믿으면 구원을 얻으리니’ (로마서10:9)


‘그러므로 이제 그리스도 예수 안에 있는 자에게는 결코 정죄함이 없나니 이는 그리스도 예수 안에 있는 자에게는 생명의 성령의 법이 죄와 사망의 법에서 너를 해방하였음이라’ (로마서 8:1-2)


Salvation is not earned by our actions or meritorious deeds, but we can believe that Jesus, the devout son of God who is innocent, bled to death on the cross for me who is guilty, beat the power of Satan, and resurrected, and I, who believe in Jesus, is resurrected like Jesus.

This is the truth of the cross and the gospel.


God does not ask you to solve your sins with your strength and effort. God only tells us to believe in the salvation that God has achieved because he knows our weakness.

This is different from other religions.


Therefore, there is true freedom, joy, and peace that the world cannot give to those who believe in Jesus.

Before God looks at how conscientious and less guilty he was, how nice he lived ethically and morally, look at the blood of the blood that Jesus shed, the life of Jesus, and the name of the Lord in your spirit.

God does not send sinners to hell, but he sends those who do not repent. Everyone, whether they realize it or not, is guilty.

It is very important whether you realize your sin as a sin and return to God with remorse or not.

 



<span class="title">6. God is waiting for you.</span>

God loves you, but he loves you to crucify and kill the solitary in his arms.

‘우리가 아직 죄인되었을 때에 그리스도께서 우리를  위하여 죽으심으로 하나님께서 우리에게 대한 자기의 사랑을 확증하셨느니라’(로마서 5:8)


God did not erase your sins against you, but instead made Jesus, the solitary, erase all of them and die.

If you really know that love, you can't help but be thrilled. God has given you the greatest sacrifice and love by loving you. Who in the world can die for you!

Because God loves you, he is still waiting for you to come back to God today with the feeling of a father waiting for his son to come back from home.


You may accept or turn a blind eye to God's call, but do not turn a blind eye to God's call. The consequences are too great. He is the creator of you and the master of life.


Scientific civilization is developing tremendously, and human wisdom seems to be great. However, there are so many diseases that medicine cannot cure, and even with advanced human science, earthquakes, typhoons, floods, droughts, and anything can do nothing but be a sad bystander. 

The amazing God who created and presided over all things in the universe

You must realize the limitations of humans before providence and ability and be humble.

As civilization develops, life becomes more convenient, but in proportion, humanity is lost, society becomes more harsh, and mentally, it is becoming more impoverished and exhausted.

God is calling for you who are tired of life.


‘수고하고 무거운 짐 진 자들아 다 내게로 오라, 내가 너희를 쉬게 하리라’ (마태복음 11:28)

The more you own the world, the more thirsty you are, the less satisfied you are, but there is a bottled water that God will never thirst for. There is real rest only to God.

He said that the peace God gives cannot be compared to the peace the world gives. Don't you enjoy the peace God gives you?

하나님께로 오기만 하면 어제의 당신이 어떤 죄와 악의 사람이었더라도 하나님은 그것을 기억조차 하지 않으십니다. (이사야 43:25)

There is no judgment for those who believe in Jesus, for Jesus was judged on the cross instead for us.

 


 
<span class="title">7. Jesus is coming again.</span>


Jesus was in the world for 40 days after the resurrection, visible to his disciples, and went up to heaven in front of 500 people and promised not to come back.


He will come back to heaven just as he had gone up to heaven as he had promised, and will take the souls who have lived for the blood he shed on the cross.

Jesus of Chorim, who came to Bethlehem, came in an extremely low manner to save the sinful humans, but Jesus, who will come again, has the power to judge all mankind, both the living and the dead, with the sound of the command and the heavenly beings and the trumpets of God

As you come, everyone in the world will see you, whether you believe it or not. 


Only those who believe in Jesus, God's abbot, and are saved, and whose name is greened in the life book, can endure the persecution of the Antichrist and protect their faith.

It will be a day of glory for the saints who have trusted and waited for the Lord, and a day of fear and regret for those who do not.

Each and every Bible prophecy that will happen before the Lord comes back is being made amazingly. At some point, all of a sudden, you have to stand before him.

At that time, you should have a jubilant confession that says, "I've been waiting for you, Jesus. Please come."

 



<span class="title">8. This is the last time.</span>


Now is the last time. Look at the signs of the world.

Earthquakes, floods, extreme weather, hunger, violence and conflict are continuing throughout the world, the ozone layer that protects humans from the sun's ultraviolet rays is rapidly being destroyed, obscene and decadence have reached its peak, dignity for life has long been lost, and genetic engineering is directly challenging God's ability to create life by creating clones.

People commit crimes, but they have no conscience because their sense of guilt is blunted.

Isn't this similar to the time of Noah's flood and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Castle, where God could no longer bear it?

Even then, people were busy with their work and enjoyed pleasure, ignoring the voice of God's warning, and were destroyed.

The Bible says that the door to salvation will be closed.

The door closes suddenly at some point.

Are you in the door now?

This is a very serious issue. Fortunately, however, the door is still open. Signs of the world and the international situation show that the Second Coming of the Lord is imminent.

International organizations such as the World Economic Forum (WEF), WHO (World Health Organization), and the United Nations have shown signs of trying to govern humanity around the world, and the world is integrating into CBDC digital currency. 

Sooner or later, the anti-Christian beast regime will emerge and insert the beast's vote into the hand or forehead, believing in Jesus and putting it in the life book

Only those whose name is green can endure to the end and protect their eternal life.


“하나님을 두려워하며 그에게 영광을 돌려라 이는 그의 심판할시간이 이르렀음으니 만일 누구든지 짐승과 그의 우상에게 경배하고 이마에나 손에 (짐승의)표를 받으면 거룩한 천사들과 어린 양 앞에서 불과 유황으로 고난을 받으리라.(요한계시록14:7~11)

  

Jesus prepared a path to atonement on the cross for all mankind. But you need to make a decision because this good path of salvation is only allowed to those who believe and accept it.

Now is the time to make the most important decision of your life. If you miss this opportunity, you may regret it forever.

Do not put off; do not guarantee that there is another tomorrow; no one has any guarantee of tomorrow. Decide to believe in Jesus right now.

And go out to the church near you.

The purpose and direction of your life will be different.

You will now be a child of God who will enjoy heaven's eternal life with the Lord, not a devil's servant who will be thrown together into the fire pit of hell.
